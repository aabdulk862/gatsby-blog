### I want to start this post off by saying that I am not a writer, I'm a developer.

Initially, I started making this blog as a project to learn Gatsby Js, a React-based framework used to make websites.
With that being said, I liked the idea of having a place where I can share some of my thoughts and experiences.

I had trouble deciding what type of content I would write about. Should I keep it strictly about web development or should include stuff about my other interests and hobbies?
Then I rememered... this MY blog. I don't have to keep it to a single theme. I should just write about what I feel like writing about.

Topics include but are not limited to: Technology, Anime (mostly One Piece), Fitness, Sports, Movies/TV, Music, and Current Events. 
The quality and functionality of this blog will improve over time as I get better at my craft. But for now... it works.
