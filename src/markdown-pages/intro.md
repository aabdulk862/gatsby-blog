### A little background info:

I was born in Lanham, MD and grew up as the middle child with 5 other sibling (3 brothers and 2 sisters).
My mom and dad immigrated here from Eritrea, a small country in East Africa. They had to adapt to a completely new culture while taking care of six kids. My dad worked in hotel management and my mom had worked her way up from help desk to a systems analyst position. My parents taught me to work hard for my goals and to always value knowledge.

When I was 6 years old we moved to Gainesville, VA and I lived there throughout highschool and college. It was during this time I developed an interest in computers and how they worked. I became the unoffical IT support desk for my friends and family. I enjoyed solving problems and got a feeling of satisfaction after I helped someone with a problem. I also enjoyed playing video games and making youtube video commentaries about my favorite games. I have always been introverted by nature, but still enjoyed making content.

During my junior and senior years of highschool I took the classes: Advanced Computer Math and AP Computer Science. This is where I was first introduced to computer programming concepts. I enjoyed the process of writing software and coming up with soultions with code. I decided to attend George Mason University in Fairfax, VA and pursue the degree: Information Technology with a concentration in Web Development and Multimedia. I got a good mix of techinal and coding knowledge along with the buisness side of technology.

Currently I am a Full-Stack Developer who is deeply knowledgeable in a wide array of front end and back end languages, responsive frameworks, databases, and best code practices.
My objective is simply to be the best web developer I can be and to make an impact on the technology industry. I am dedicated to perfecting my craft by learning everday and pushing my abilities with code.
