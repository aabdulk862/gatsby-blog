### A short story about me:

I was born in Lanham, Maryland and grew up as the middle child with 5 other sibling (3 brothers and 2 sisters).
My mom and dad immigrated here from Eritrea, a small country in East Africa. They had to adapt to a completely new culture while taking care of six kids. My parents taught me to work hard for my goals and to always value knowledge.

When I was 6 years old we moved to Gainesville, Virginia and I lived there throughout highschool and college. It was during this time I developed an interest in computers and how they worked. I became the unoffical IT support desk for my friends and family. I enjoyed solving problems and got a feeling of satisfaction after I helped someone with a problem.

During my junior and senior years of highschool I took the classes: Advanced Computer Math and AP Computer Science. This is where I was first introduced to computer programming concepts.
